A new frontier of medicine in the twenty first century - Genomic Medicine



## SOLUTION DEMO AND EXPLANATION LINK

## Problem Statement:
In current scenario medicines and treatment are same for a particular disease.
Still a treatment or medicine cure 50% of the patients and rest suffer.
High costs of medicines contribute to decreased access to healthcare.
About 60-90 per cent of healthcare spending by poor people is on prescribed medicines which never benefited them.
Sixty per cent (499-649 million) of the population in India does not have regular access to essential medicines.
Even after a lot of expenditure, 60% of the patients fail to get the benefit for from the treatment or medicines (According to NCBI)

# Our Solution
## Genomic Medicine
DNA sequencing has propelled genomics into mainstream medicine, driving a revolutionary shift toward precision medicine.
Genomics investigates how a person's biological information can be used to improve their clinical care and health outcomes (eg through effective diagnosis and personalised treatment.
Goal of precision or genomic medicine is that instead of a “one size fits all” approach by disease type, medicine will be informed by a genetic understanding of the disease. 
Precision medicine not only involves studying the genome, but also considers factors like where a person lives, what they do, and what their family health history . 
Our goal is to develop targeted prevention or treatment approaches with the power of ai algorithms and interactive analyzation low-cost software to help specific individuals stay healthy or get better instead of relying on approaches that are the same for everyone.

## Genomic Sequence
99% genome similar,1% differences causes uniqueness.
Genome and body relation is like a ingredient and food.
ATGC bases patterns.
Genomic pattern study tells 
what are we made for.

## Proof Of Concept 
(How cancer can be cured with genomic AI analysis)
Human has the genomic alterations from generation to generations.
CANCER alterations called somatic alterations.
Genome expresses the disease.
Cancer on the same tissue is not one disease.

## What Bothers?
disadvantage of Indian medical department
the usage of broad-spectrum drugs(current scnerio) .
attacking the targeted cells but along with it , harms the normal cell 
inviting more diseases.
Chemotherapy a broad spectrum therapy.

## Remedy
NARROW SPECTRUM TREATMENT
PARP INHIBITOR THERAPY
A breast cancer or ovarian Cancer patient Caring  BRCA 1 gene  involved in dna repair and genomic instability
genomic drugs attacking the specific cancer cell proteins and killing them.

## Our Idea
An interactive AI approach towards personalized genomic sequencing and medicine
Doctors and patients can use our AI features for sequencing processes to analyze the genomic information and finding personalized cure. 
1. Single nucleotide polymorphism detection for position on gene, scaffold name, associated disease of phenotype, drug linked to disease, and adverse drug reaction annotation.
2. DNA SEQUENCING TO PROVIDE PRECISE DIAGNOSIS AND MEDICAL TREATMENT SUGGESTIONS

## Market Opportunity
Being one of its kind, SequenceMe would prove to be quite essential and helpful to hospitals worldwide and healthcare researchers in diagnosing patients through DNA and genomic sequencing.
Since, people will genetic disorders would be able to get personalized treatments, it would be a game changer in world of personalized digital healthcare.
The large sets of genomic data could be used for future researches and refrences thereby providing vast real world datasets.
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020 (WHO). However, these can be prevented if it is diagnosed early. 
Our Cancer Risk Prediction Tool that uses DNA sequencing can play a vital role in this issue.
Despite of some excellent existing softwares, the healthcare facilities are not avaialable at ground level for everyone. 
People like us could access personalized reports and predictions using SequenceMe easily, instead of spending thousands of money on appointments.
